# Disease Prediction 

Healthcare professionals often rely on various diagnostic tests and biomarkers to assess an individual's 
health status and diagnose diseases. In this scenario, we have access to a dataset containing multiple 
health-related attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood cell counts, hormone levels, and other 
physiological measurements. The dataset also includes information on whether the individual has been 
diagnosed with a specific disease or not.
